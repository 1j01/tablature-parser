# Tablature Parser

A JavaScript tablature parser that parses guitar tabs.

## TODO

* Establish and document a decent API
* Compile the CoffeeScript in a build step and publish to npm
* Parse articulations
* Support alternate tunings
* Support other instruments
* Somehow include the often vague or incorrect timing information
